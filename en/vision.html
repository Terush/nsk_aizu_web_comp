                    Aizuwakamatsu City, where we live and work, is facing a big turning point.<br>
                    Over the last 10 years, the population has dropped by about 12,000 people, and the city is aging.<br>
                    These numbers show a quiet but real shadow falling over our community's energy.
                </p>
                <p class="vision-text">
                    Especially serious is the number of empty houses, which has reached 18.33%.<br>
                    This number is much higher than the national average, and it's not just a statistic.<br>
                    Places where people once lived are now silent.<br>
                    This scenery makes the connections between people feel weaker, too.
                </p>
                <p class="vision-text">
                    But we will not give up.<br>
                    Abandoned land and buildings can be "resources" that create new value if we change how we look at them.<br>
                    We want to turn empty houses into places for people to gather, and turn unused land into fruitful farms.<br>
                    NSK_AIZU has started moving to bring real "liveliness" back to this city by regenerating local resources and creating connections across generations.
