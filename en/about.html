                    <p class="about-text">
                        Aizuwakamatsu City is facing a declining and aging population.
                        In the last 10 years, the population dropped by about 12,000, and the empty house rate hit 18.33%, far above the national average.
                        Unused farmland and empty houses are becoming "negative legacies" that take away the region's energy.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-text">
                        NSK_AIZU's mission is to reverse this flow.
                        We will regenerate abandoned farmland and turn empty houses into places for exchange.
                        We redefine these overlooked places as new "resources" and aim to bring real liveliness back to the city through agriculture, Aizu's key industry.

                    <p class="about-text">
                        Our greatest strength is the youthful energy of University of Aizu students and our knowledge of IT and Data Science.
                        We don't just farm. We use sensors to collect and analyze data, aiming to establish "reproducible cultivation methods" that don't rely only on experience or intuition.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-text">
                        At the same time, we are not afraid of hard, muddy work.
                        We enter abandoned farmland totaling about 3,000 square meters to cut grass, till the soil, and make ridges.
                        Combining "Technology" and "Physical Work," we will build a sustainable farmland regeneration model together with the local government and residents.

                        This activity is for farmers worried about a lack of successors, and for local people concerned about the scenery getting worse.
                        But more than that, we exist for the "future leaders."

                        "I'm interested in agriculture, but I don't know how to get involved."
                        For such young people, we will be a "window" that lowers the hurdles to farming.
                        From short-term experiences to becoming full-time farmers.
                        By creating a cycle where students invite other students, we will connect Aizu's agriculture and land to the next generation.
